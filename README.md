# My ML Journey

ðŸ’¡ Idea: aggregate all of my notes, projects, etc into a single repo to track progress and info on my machine learning journey.

### Directory Layout

`/projects` - Personal projects with open data - NOTE: Data is omitted from the repo but links to data provided in code / readmes

`/notes` - Notes from videos, books, blogs etc.
